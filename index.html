                <p>
                    I am a current student at the University of Washington pursuing a degree
                    in Computer Science. I decided to create this website to showcase my skills
                    and show off any side projects I have accomplished. Since I'm not sure what
                    I truly like, I have dabbled in a little bit of everything, from a range
                    to 3D graphics to machine learning projects, to even creating a retail
                    website for bananas. If you are interested in learning more, please
                    simply scroll down to view those projects. (add more personal information.)

                <p>Uh oh! There are currently no projects to display! Check back later!</p>
                <!--Populate this with DIVS that will display the amount of projects.
                    Create a small dtatabase right here to simply type in a pull information-->

                <p>I actually have not decided what I wanted to make this page. COme back later to see if i change this!</p>
